# Project 2 - Sound Exploration
## Process
### Week 1: October 12 - 18
#### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create an interactive (possibly game-like) exploration of sound. The interactive sound experience that I will be creating will play like a first person game, though it's not much of a game as there is no objective other than to make weird song loops. The player will be able to "pull" these pool-noodle-looking creatures out of the ground, probably with an interaction like left click and drag, and then set them on an oscillation tragectory, probably with an interaction like right click -> drag -> release. Then each time the oscillating pool noodle thing bounces back and forth it chimes a note based on how long/tall the thing is.
#### MVP
As mentioned in the grading contract, the minimum viable product is the only thing that matters as far as the main deliverable of the project is concerned. I would certainly *love* to exceed the MVP, but when I'm juggling projects from literally every single class at once I need to keep my expectations realistic to avoid the pressure (that I put on myself) boiling over which would result in a worst product for all of my classes.

The main core gameplay/interaction loop described in the project overview is absolutely essential to the MVP: left click to change the thing's length (or create a new thing) and right click to change the speed at which it oscillates.

On top of the core interaction loop, I want at least one additional "setting" such as different instrumentation or filter profiles. In the extras section of this process log I'll mention all of the possible settings that I've brainstormed and I can pick from.

#### Extras
Even though I'm *supposed* to not pressure myself to include things above and beyond the MVP, there's a lot of stuff that I just really want to include as well:

The graphics are absolutely not essential to the MVP of this class; it's a sound class not a graphics class. But I would love for this project to look really nice, so if I have the time to, you know I'm gunsta be making it look pretty.

There are also a bunch of "settings" that I'd like to include that the player can change about the next noodle thing they will pull out of the ground. As mentioned earlier, I want to pick at least one of these to make it in to the MVP, and any more than that are extras:

  * Instrumentation change tied to color of the noodle. This could be a finite choice of colors mapped to a finite choice of samples, or it could be an entire color wheel selector mapped to parameters of a synthesizer.
  * Filter profile tied to shape of the noodle creature. A noodle dude that's fatter on the bottom than the top could have a low pass filter on whereas a noodle dude that's fatter on top than on bottom could have a high pass filter.
  * Reverb tied to the thickness of the outline of the noodle creature. Assuming I get there graphically where outlines matter...
  * Different faces on the noodle dudes tied to different ASDR presets to give them character.
  * A "quantize" button to optionally lock the oscillations of the noodle dudes to a 1/16 or 1/32 or 1/64 (probably customizable) grid.
  * A spatial audio on-off button (spatial audio will not be included in the MVP by default).

## Grading Contract
What I've learned from working on so many ATLAS projects over the years is that what's most important to me is to have a well documented process log of the project. Something that I can not only show to any potential future employers, but also something that I can look back on to reflect on my own thought process through the project. I find it incredibly helpful to look back on my own thought process in a previous project if I find myself working on anything with any shared aspect. I've  looked back at my own undergraduate capstone project's process log at least 5 times now, not because I even remotely enjoyed reading my own (quite cringey because I never edited it for spelling mistakes or typos) writing, but because reviewing my own though process would make creating something related so much easier. All that is to say that my number one priority for this project to get an A is to have a clear well documented weekly progress log that covers my thought process througout the development of the project. Beyond a great process log, the next important thing to me is meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) for the project on time. I'd love to go beyond just an MVP for this project, I'd love that for all my projects, but I know that it's important for me not to put any pressure on myself to actually do that, and just an MVP is good enough for an A for me. And the third and final thing that I need to do to accomplish an A is to stay exploratory in the sound domain. 3D graphics and games are super fun and super cool to work on, and especially because they're still relatively novel to me as a developer even after several years, it's still really easy to get sucked into being experimental in the 3D graphics domain rather than the sound domain. I need to keep myself in line and not forget that the whole goal of the class is to do something with *sound* not with graphics. So to recap, my grading contract is as follows:
### Grade breakdown by letter
- **A**
  - Well documented weekly (Mondays) progress log
  - Roughly follows the predicted timeline documented below
  - Meets MVP (as described in week 1 process log)
  - Is about the *sound*
- **B**
  - Process log is missing a week, or is riddled with too many typos and grammatical errors
  - Actual timeline is significantly off from prediction (if I procrastinate too hard)
  - Project falls short of MVP
  - Focuses on graphics (or something else) more than on sound
- **C**
  - Process log is barely filled with any useful information at all
  - Multiple deadlines are missed
  - Something that's very much still "in development" to show by the end
  - Sound is just barely incorporated, nothing experimental at all
- **D** or **F**
  - Let's be honest, I'm not gonna allow this to happen to myself, but this could be if I just quit the project halfway through, or if I have like literally nothing to show by the end of the project (and no good reason either, like I would ask for an extension if I had a good reason, so I would need no good reason to fail), or if I blantantly plagiarize something that's obviously a 0% right there
### Timeline
- **Week 1**: October 12 - 18
  - The first process log, due Monday October 18 at class time, will be my official project proposal, detailing the main goals of my project, technologies I intend on using, the interactions the user will go through, what I intend to make into the MVP and what I think are the first things I want to add post-MVP, and finally a couple of drawings or wireframe mockups to visually communicate my ideas.
  - Also during this week I will be getting started on development of the project, though I'm not sure if I will include this in the week 1 process log or hold onto that documentation and save it for week 2 when I will be talking about 90% of the rest of the development.
  - Developmentally, by the 18th I want to have a prototype/proof of concept that is exploring the main interaction loop of the experience.
- **Week 2**: October 19 - 25
  - The second process log, due Monday October 25, will cover the vast majority of the development of the project, going over multiple fine development details and fun quirks that I experienced over the week (and a half) prior.
  - Developmentally I should be very close to my MVP that was outlined in the last week, as there's only 2 more days left after this process log before the due date/presentation day for the project. At this point I would *love* it if there were only a few details left to iron out, and some bug fixes to take place, instead of any significant development left.
- **Week 3**: October 26 - November 1
  - The third and final week of this project starts with a few last nights of (hopefully not crammed) development followed by presenting the project on October 27. After the project is completed and presented and everything I still want to turn in one last process log on Monday November 1, because I want to talk about how the project was recieved, and I want to try include the feedback that I got and the improvements that I should make, so that when I'm reflecting back on this process log in the future I can actually remember those things.
