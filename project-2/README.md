# Project 2 - Sound Exploration
## Grading Contract
What I've learned from working on so many ATLAS projects over the years is that what's most important to me is to have a well documented process log of the project. Something that I can not only show to any potential future employers, but also something that I can look back on to reflect on my own thought process through the project. I find it incredibly helpful to look back on my own thought process in a previous project if I find myself working on anything with any shared aspect. I've  looked back at my own undergraduate capstone project's process log at least 5 times now, not because I even remotely enjoyed reading my own (quite cringey because I never edited it for spelling mistakes or typos) writing, but because reviewing my own though process would make creating something related so much easier. All that is to say that my number one priority for this project to get an A is to have a clear well documented weekly progress log that covers my thought process througout the development of the project. Beyond a great process log, the next important thing to me is meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) for the project on time. I'd love to go beyond just an MVP for this project, I'd love that for all my projects, but I know that it's important for me not to put any pressure on myself to actually do that, and just an MVP is good enough for an A for me. And the third and final thing that I need to do to accomplish an A is to stay exploratory in the sound domain. 3D graphics and games are super fun and super cool to work on, and especially because they're still relatively novel to me as a developer even after several years, it's still really easy to get sucked into being experimental in the 3D graphics domain rather than the sound domain. I need to keep myself in line and not forget that the whole goal of the class is to do something with *sound* not with graphics. So to recap, my grading contract is as follows:
### Grade breakdown by letter
- **A**
  - Well documented weekly (Mondays) progress log
  - Roughly follows the predicted timeline documented below
  - Meets MVP (as described in week 1 process log)
  - Is about the *sound*
- **B**
  - Process log is missing a week, or is riddled with too many typos and grammatical errors
  - Actual timeline is significantly off from prediction (if I procrastinate too hard)
  - Project falls short of MVP
  - Focuses on graphics (or something else) more than on sound
- **C**
  - Process log is barely filled with any useful information at all
  - Multiple deadlines are missed
  - Something that's very much still "in development" to show by the end
  - Sound is just barely incorporated, nothing experimental at all
- **D** or **F**
  - Let's be honest, I'm not gonna allow this to happen to myself, but this could be if I just quit the project halfway through, or if I have like literally nothing to show by the end of the project (and no good reason either, like I would ask for an extension if I had a good reason, so I would need no good reason to fail), or if I blantantly plagiarize something that's obviously a 0% right there
### Timeline
- **Week 1**: October 12 - 18
  - The first process log, due Monday October 18 at class time, will be my official project proposal, detailing the main goals of my project, technologies I intend on using, the interactions the user will go through, what I intend to make into the MVP and what I think are the first things I want to add post-MVP, and finally a couple of drawings or wireframe mockups to visually communicate my ideas.
  - Also during this week I will be getting started on development of the project, though I'm not sure if I will include this in the week 1 process log or hold onto that documentation and save it for week 2 when I will be talking about 90% of the rest of the development.
  - Developmentally, by the 18th I want to have a prototype/proof of concept that is exploring the main interaction loop of the experience.
- **Week 2**: October 19 - 25
  - The second process log, due Monday October 25, will cover the vast majority of the development of the project, going over multiple fine development details and fun quirks that I experienced over the week (and a half) prior.
  - Developmentally I should be very close to my MVP that was outlined in the last week, as there's only 2 more days left after this process log before the due date/presentation day for the project. At this point I would *love* it if there were only a few details left to iron out, and some bug fixes to take place, instead of any significant development left.
- **Week 3**: October 26 - November 1
  - The third and final week of this project starts with a few last nights of (hopefully not crammed) development followed by presenting the project on October 27. After the project is completed and presented and everything I still want to turn in one last process log on Monday November 1, because I want to talk about how the project was recieved, and I want to try include the feedback that I got and the improvements that I should make, so that when I'm reflecting back on this process log in the future I can actually remember those things.
